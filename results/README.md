# Performance Results

Keep the experiment outputs that are safe to check into git separated from raw profiler dumps.

- `profiles/` should hold raw traces/logs (ignored by git by default).  Document how to regenerate them.
- `summaries/` is where you can store CSV/Markdown tables, charts, and notebooks that summarize the deltas between baselines and the optimized pipeline.
