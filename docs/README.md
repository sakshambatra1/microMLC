# Documentation

Use this folder to capture design decisions, diagrams, and performance narratives that explain *why* a pass pipeline works.

- `design/` – architecture notes, pass-ordering discussions, and diagrams (drop artifacts into `docs/assets/`).
- `performance/` – links to `results/` plus commentary tying measurements back to compiler choices.
